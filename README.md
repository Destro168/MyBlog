# The Tech Noob's Note Keeping App - Noob Notes

This is my custom blogging/note-taking web application. It is a huge work in progress, but progress will be made every weekend as necessary until I'm satisfied to call this application relased at version 1.0.

I am making this project because it will be personally very useful for me as an efficient, enterprise-level web service for note keeping.

I'm tired of all of the free 'sticky-note lite' apps out there with cute interfaces and limited functionality. I want advanced date-tracking, searching, storage, retrieval and management of my notes, so that every note is potentially useful even 10 years from now. And, so that I don't get stuck looking forever for a particular note.

I am also using this as a method to refresh some of the skills that will be necessary for my next job at my next place of employment.

Look forward to it!
