1.) Fix URL for routing, etc. properly to pass category through body.
2.) Add drop-down in create section that lets you choose a category for your post.
3.) Add a filter option for categories that let's you filter what you see by category. When you select an option from the drop-down, all results are filtered.




Add date range fields to customize results shown even further.
