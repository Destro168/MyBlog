BIG TODO:

Fix bug where pagination not working across multiple days. (Next patch)

Current idea is to count up how many variables are available at each year/month/day.
This will require modifying syncFilterDataObject to count up these totals for use in getFilteredData() to perfectly slice records dynamically.

(Currently, it slices up to 5 per day, needs to slice 5 universally).
