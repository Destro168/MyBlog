    TODO:
=============

Priority:
- Add user accounts + authentication for securtiy reasons.

Design:
- Expandable/Collapsable Sections on page.
- Add light colored borders to posts based on date. (Maybe a colored icon.)
- Add icons to the various buttons.
- When a button or option is selected, fade the button out.

Features:

- Move the filter options and mass operations to a modal called "Options". Inside add:
    * Mass delete capability with options.
    * Export/Import features.
- Actually use 'handleError' in http.server.ts using angular 7 guidelines.

- In new post section, make textarea submit when hitting the enter key, and let shift+enter create a new line. Also, make hitting submit return focus to textarea.

Code Cleanup/Optimization:

- Take advantage of interfaces throughout code.
- Continually cleanup code.
- Make formContent information into an object.

====================================
    SUPER FUTURE TODO... MAYBE:
====================================

- Add business model to make money?
- Add real-time synchronization of data to all connected clients. (Too data heavy maybe?)
